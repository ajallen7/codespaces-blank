<h1>Eagles..America Right? </h1>
<h2>Sure..but here are some things to know about the bald eagle.</h2>

<h2>1. Bald Eagles Can Reach Altitudes Up to<strong><em> 10,000</em> </strong> ft!</h2>
<p>Their astonishing wingspan of way more that decoartive: it allows them to fly at insane heights! Bald eagles soar 10,000 ft or more in the air, using thermal air currents to support their glide(eagles tend to glide more than flap). This allows them to conserve energy for more important activities, like looking for prey and traveling long distances.</p>

<h2>2. Their Eyesight is 8x Stronger Than Ours</h2>
<p>We call a person an “eagle eye” if they have 20/20 vision, but Bald Eagles have much sharper eyesight than that! In fact, they typically have 20/40 or 20/50 vision, making them expert hunters. Not only can they spot a small animal two miles away with amazing clarity, but they have a 340-degree field of view—with even better peripheral vision than owls!</p>

<h2>3. Their Iconic Call Actually Isn't Theirs</h2>
<p>The loud and vibrant call you hear often in movies or maybe in the wild is actually by another hawk; the Red-Tailed Hawk! The bald eagles' call actually sounds a bit anticlimactic and dissapointing.</p>
